# Data-Science-Projects

This repository presents a few of my work involves building machine learning model with statistcal methods such as logistic regression, using natural language process method to analyze text, and web scraping to understand market conditions. 

## Prisme LinkedIn Web Scraping 
This was an intern project with Prisme, Inc. My main responsibility was to write Python codes to web scrape LinkedIn job posting information such as title, location, description, company name, posted at, etc. With the available data, I use natural language process (e.g. Bag of words) to analyze the existing job market particularly for "Data Analyst/Scientist" and directly report to the CEO of the company. 

## Bank Marketing Campaign Analysis 
This individual project showcases my well-rounded understanding of a predictive model project. From assessing the quality of the data using visualization to applying various statistical models to predict bank churn, Python was used to perform all of these steps. With the data being imbalanced, manipulation of data was necessary to achieve our goal. 

## Natural Language Processing
This is a series of mini-project which demonstrated my application of Natural Language process with statistical methods to perform text analysis using Python. In this project, TFIDF, Bag of Words, Ensemble methods, and feature engineering were used individually with my experimentation of whichever lead to the best result. 

## Social Network Analysis 
This is an investigation of product line's social structures through the use of networks and graph theory using R language. By examining the closeness & betweenness and network structure, we are able to find the product that has the most control over the network; hence, more information will pass through that node. Thereby, establishing an understanding that using that product to promote will likely be more efficient.
